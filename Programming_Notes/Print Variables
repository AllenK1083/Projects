Use these methods to print variables without the need of concatenation.

let name = "Allen";
let city = "New York City";
let birthYear = 1983;

console.log(`My name is ${name}, I live in ${city}, and I was born in ${birthYear}.`);
My name is Allen, I live in New York City, and I was born in 1983.

Python
name = "Allen"
city = "New York City"
birth_year = 1983

print(f"My name is {name}, I live in {city}, and I was born in {birth_year}.")
My name is Allen, I live in New York City, and I was born in 1983.
